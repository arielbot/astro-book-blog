## My Week in Review

<b style="font-size: 16px">WHAT AM I</b>

<b>Reading:</b> "You Belong Here" by Diana Rostad

Found-family western. Deals with ranch life and the orphan aide society.

<b>Watching:</b> "Bridgerton Season 2" 

I feel like I heard so much about Bridgerton season 1, that I just had to skip it entirely. Season 2 has some nice twists I wasn't expecting. Sweet and fun. It's no Jane Austen Masterpiece Classic, but it will do.

<b>Listening:</b> "Limbo" by Freddie Dredd

This song sounds like someone produced it on Garageband in their parents basement.

<b>Tasting:</b> Fresh eggs ðŸ¥š

I love our little backyard flock. 6 chickens = 4+ eggs a day.
