## My Week in Review

<b style="font-size: 16px">WHAT AM I</b>

<b>Reading:</b> "Something in the Heir" by Suzanne Enoch

Very cute. Not what I would consider a romance, but a fun read nonetheless.

<b>Watching:</b> "Alone: Season 6" 

This show is like crystal meth. I started it due to peer pressure, and now I can't stop. There is A LOT of unintentional fires this season. Also, people don't seem to realize that lake water still NEEDS to be boiled. That ain't no mountain spring, and Bambi will wreck revenge on your intestines.

<b>Listening:</b> "Anti-Hero (country version)" by Josiah and the Bonnevilles

Really love me some indie covers of Taylor Swift. You're dead to me Ryan Adams. DEAD.

<b>Tasting:</b> Sweet potato pie ðŸ¥§

The pumpkin pie was sold out, but this was still a tasty alternative.
