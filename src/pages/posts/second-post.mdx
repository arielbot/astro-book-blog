## My Week in Review

<b style="font-size: 16px">WHAT AM I</b>

<b>Reading:</b> "Something in the Heir" by Suzanne Enoch

<b>Watching:</b> "Alone: Season 6" 

Somehow boring and entertaining the same time. A lot of unintentional fire this season. Also, people don't seem to realize that lake water still NEEDS to be boiled. That ain't no mountain spring.

<b>Listening:</b> "Anti-Hero (country version)" by Josiah and the Bonnevilles

<b>Tasting:</b> Sweet potato pie ðŸ¥§
