This is a site (built with <a href="https://astro.build/" class="inline-block cactus-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label="astro build">Astro</a>) where I review books, movies, and possibly share fun stuff about web development. All my favorite things! Ok, not really, but creating sites about the other things I like might be heavily frowned upon in polite society.

			<li>Cold beverages only, please</li>
			<li>Derry Girls is my comfort show</li>
			<li>Web developer by trade</li>
			<li>Give me Historal Romance or give me death ðŸ’€</li>
